                              summary: HuggingGPT is a framework using ChatGPT as a central controller to orchestrate various AI models from Hugging Face to solve complex tasks. ChatGPT plans the task, selects appropriate models based on their descriptions, executes subtasks, and summarizes the results. This approach addresses limitations of LLMs by allowing them to handle multimodal data (vision, speech) and coordinate multiple models for complex tasks, paving the way for more advanced AI systems.

While there are abundant AI models available for different domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI tasks. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional ability in language understanding, generation, interaction, and reasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing AI models to solve complicated AI tasks and language could be a generic interface to empower t'
